Chapter 1

	Web browser displays content identified by URL. First step is to use URL to connect to server
	somwhere on internet and download that information


	URL looks like this:

	http://example.org/index.html

	scheme: http                    -----> HOW to get information
	hostname: example.org           -----> WHERE to get information
	path: index.html                -----> WHAT information to get

	
	With a URL, the browser can ask the OS to get in touch with server described by hostname
	OS uses talks to DNS server which converts host name to a destination IP address
	etc
	(this is not a networking course)

	On macOS, one can use netcat to connect to server:

	   nc -v example.org 80

	On Linux, one can use telnet to connect to server:

	   telnet example.org 80


	You'll get an output that looks like this:

	       Trying 93.184.216.34...
	       Connectd to example.org.
	       Escape character is '^]'

	This means that the OS converted host name example.org into 93.184.216.34

	Once connected to the server, the web browser requests information from server by giving its path
	In our example URL, the path is /index.html

	The request looks like this:

	    GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
	    Host: example.org

	GET means browser would like to recieve information, then comes the path /index.html,
	then the version of HTTP the browser is using to communicate, HTTP/1.0

	After the first line, each line contains a header, consisting of
	a name (eg, Host) and a value (eg example.org)

	After the headers comes a single blank line, this tells the host you are done with headers
